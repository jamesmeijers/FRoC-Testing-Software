This is a package of testing software made for the FRoC FPGA DVS System

The project contains two parts, the testing software (with its own readme)
and a buildbot (whose pertinent information is in the master.cfg file)

The code is currently set up for a specific linux workstation, but the 
readme in FRoC_TEST_PACKAGE contains information on how to get it to work on
any linux station. 

FRoC, the program being tested, is available here: https://github.com/Ibrahimai/FRoC
